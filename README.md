# insurance-firm-analysis-report

This repo provides a short analysis on the financial data of a number of insurance firms, answering the question of which ones in particular should receive the most supervisory attention and resources. The analysis was performed in python in Jupyter Notebook. Data for the firms is contained within the `Data` folder with the analysis within the `report.ipynb` file. There is a `requirements.txt` for the analysis in the notebook but the command line to install the required packages is ran in the first code cell in the notebook.
